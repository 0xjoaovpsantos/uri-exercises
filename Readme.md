# URI Exercises

This project was done with the purpose of serve as a study of the Java language and programming logic

## Getting Started

If you are interested, all exercises are available on the [URI Online Judge](https://www.urionlinejudge.com.br/judge/en/login)

### Prerequisites

To test some program from this repository, you need to have Java installed on your machine, if you do not have it, Java has a documentation explaining [how to install the Java virtual machine](https://www.java.com/pt_BR/download/help/windows_manual_download.xml)

## Running the tests

Once you have installed the Java virtual machine, to test some program, you only have to go to your command prompt, and gowhere the program is:
```
C:\Users\Joao Victor>cd C:\Users\Joao Victor\Documents\Repositorios\uri-exercises\beginners\1012 - Área
```

Then compile the program:
```
C:\Users\Joao Victor\Documents\Repositorios\uri-exercises\beginners\1012 - Área>javac Main.java
```

And now just run:
```
C:\Users\Joao Victor\Documents\Repositorios\uri-exercises\beginners\1012 - Área>java Main
3
5
9.8
```

In this case, program 1012 will return you:
```
TRIANGULO: 14,700
CIRCULO: 301,718
TRAPEZIO: 39,200
QUADRADO: 25,000
RETANGULO: 15,000
```
